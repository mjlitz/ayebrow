Game Ideas

1. Create a cost system which changes based on demand. Less-in-demand techs/strategies will become cheaper.
	This should help make sure that the game is balanced.
2. Like Risk Legacy, have a couple of changes that cannot be undone. This might encourage users to make more than one account, though.
3. People like instant feedback and levels. Implement this.
4. Make a game that you will most like playing. Others will follow suit.
